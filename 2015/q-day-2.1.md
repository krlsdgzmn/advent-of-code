# --- Day 2: I Was Told There Would Be No Math ---

The elves are running low on wrapping paper, and so they need to submit an order for more. They have a list of the dimensions (length l, width w, and height h) of each present, and only want to order exactly as much as they need.

Fortunately, every present is a box (a perfect right rectangular prism), which makes calculating the required wrapping paper for each gift a little easier: find the surface area of the box, which is 2lw + 2wh + 2hl. The elves also need a little extra paper for each present: the area of the smallest side.

For example:

- A present with dimensions 2x3x4 requires 2x6 + 2x12 + 2x8 = 52 square feet of wrapping paper plus 6 square feet of slack, for a total of 58 square feet.

- A present with dimensions 1x1x10 requires 2x1 + 2x10 + 2x10 = 42 square feet of wrapping paper plus 1 square foot of slack, for a total of 43 square feet.

All numbers in the elves' list are in feet. How many total square feet of wrapping paper should they order?
